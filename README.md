# Here is my portfolio V2

This time I wanted to make a more "cyber" design, and opted for the classic tty esthetic.

## Objectives
Display my work experiences, studies, projects but also use it as kind of a blog for my CTFs writeups!

## Features
- Shell like interface
- Simple commands: ls, cat, cd, pwd, help
- commands history
- command completion
- File explorer for the non techs! Still wanted the ux to be somewhat accessible.
- md file parsing

### To be implemented
- Simple audio player, with a pretty wave form at the bottom
- music start | music stop command
- maybe an additional page for the md writeups, to make it clearer rather than displaying them directly in the terminal
- ** Responsiveness **
